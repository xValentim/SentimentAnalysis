# Sentiment Analysis with Spark Naive Bayes

## Overview
This project implements sentiment analysis using the Naive Bayes classifier within Apache Spark. The goal is to classify text into positive or negative sentiment categories. Sentiment analysis helps in understanding opinions, emotions, and attitudes expressed in textual data.

## Naive Bayes Model
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. It assumes independence between features, hence the "naive" assumption. For sentiment analysis, it calculates the probability of a text belonging to a specific sentiment class (positive or negative) based on the occurrence of words/features in that class.

## Applications of Naive Bayes in the Market

1. **Social Media Monitoring:** Naive Bayes models are extensively used to analyze sentiments expressed in social media posts, helping companies understand customer opinions about products or services.
2. **Customer Feedback Analysis:** Businesses utilize Naive Bayes models to process and analyze customer reviews and feedback, enabling them to make data-driven decisions for product improvements.
3. **Market Sentiment Analysis:** In financial markets, sentiment analysis with Naive Bayes assists in predicting market movements based on news articles, social media trends, and public sentiment.

## Conclusion
The Naive Bayes classifier implemented within Apache Spark offers a scalable and efficient solution for sentiment analysis tasks. Its simplicity, along with Spark's distributed computing capabilities, makes it a valuable tool for analyzing large volumes of textual data and extracting sentiment information.

By leveraging the power of Spark and the Naive Bayes algorithm, this project aims to provide insights into sentiment analysis and its applications in various industries.
